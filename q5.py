# One of the most and ancient tactics in war is encirclement. It works by
# surrounding the position to isolate enemy forces. The most common reasons is
# to actually prevent outside reinforcements and supplies.
#
# With having the enemy forces encircled, attacker can focus on attacking
# multiple enemy points in the inner circle. When this happens, defender (those
# inside the circle) either must fight to the death in order for them to break
# the encirclement, or surrender.
#
# [Encirclement image - outer points of polygon are selected only]
#
# You, as Admiral General Aladeen most trusted programmer, has been instructed
# to create a program, which can calculate which enemy units to attack with the
# intention of creating encirclement for inner enemy units. One strict
# condition that he asked is to never let enemy units to be outside of the
# encirclement, or else disaster will happen. Beware, you donâ€™t want to
# disappoint Aladeen, right?
#
# Input Format
#
# - First line of input is an integer N, where N is the number of enemy units.
# - For the next N lines, there are two integers X and Y, where these denote
# point coordinates of enemy units.
#
# Constraints
#
# - 3 <= N <= 100
# - 0 <= X, Y <= 1,000
#
# Output Format
#
# Output all point coordinates of enemy units to attack based on Admiral
# General Aladeen instruction above. Output the points sorted by X then by Y.
#
# Sample Input 0
